# Odin Sign-Up Form 📋

A simple sign-up form built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundations curriculum.

## 🖱️ Project Overview

This project is a simple sign-up form created to demonstrate skills with form client side validation. 

### ✨ Features

- Input fields for user details (name, email, password)
- **Form validation with regex** – checks for empty fields, invalid email format, and password requirements (e.g., minimum length, special characters)
- **Error messages** – informative error messages are displayed when the user fails to meet the input requirements
- **Responsive design** – the form is mobile-friendly and adjusts for different screen sizes
- CSS for styling the form and enhancing the user experience

## 💡 Core Skills Practiced

- **HTML forms** – structuring a form with various input fields and buttons
- **CSS pseudoclasses** – leveraging pseudoclasses like `:invalid`, `:valid`, `:required`, and more for client-side form validation and styling
- **Responsive design** – making sure the form works well across different screen sizes using media queries
- **User feedback** – providing visual feedback to users by using pseudoclasses for error handling and highlighting invalid input
